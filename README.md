***Building a Car Race Game with Flutter and Flame and soc estimation using Extended Kalman Filter***

This project provides functionality to interpolate the current of a battery based on the state of charge (SOC) and voltage values. The project is implemented in Dart and uses bilinear interpolation to estimate the current values from provided battery data.

## Introduction

The Battery Current Interpolation project is designed to help estimate the current of a battery given specific SOC and voltage values. This is particularly useful for applications in battery management systems where accurate current prediction is crucial.

## Features

- Provides a class for battery data (`BatteryData`) and current data (`CurrentData`).
- Uses bilinear interpolation to estimate the battery current based on SOC and voltage.
- Includes utility functions to handle and process data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/battery-current-interpolation.git
   cd battery-current-interpolation

**Introduction:**

Flame is like a secret weapon for creating games in Flutter. It's a game engine built specifically for Flutter apps, and it simplifies the process of building 2D games. With Flame, you can easily handle game loops, rendering graphics, and handling user input. It's like having a cheat code that makes game development in Flutter faster and more fun.


**Game Structure and GameÂ Loop:**

**Game Structure:**

Think of a game as a well-organized party. Just like a party has different elements such as guests, decorations, and activities, a game also has its own components. In a game, you have things like characters, objects, backgrounds, and rules that define how the game works. These components work together to create an enjoyable experience for the players.

**Game Loop:**

The game loop is like the heartbeat of a game. It's a continuous process that keeps everything in the game running smoothly. Imagine you're playing a game where you control a car. The game loop ensures that the car keeps moving, the obstacles keep coming, and everything happens in sync.
